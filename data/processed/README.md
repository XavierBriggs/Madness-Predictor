# Processed Data Directory

## Overview
This directory contains the cleaned, transformed, and structured data files used for training the March Madness prediction model and generating tournament predictions. These files are derived from the raw data through various processing scripts.

## Data Files

### Team Data
- `teams.csv`: Comprehensive team statistics and features used for model training

### Tournament Structure
- `round1.csv` through `round6.csv`: Tournament bracket structure for each round

### Matchup Data
- `matchups1.csv` through `matchups6.csv`: Generated matchup data for each tournament round
  - Each file contains paired team statistics for potential matchups
  - Used as input for the prediction model

## Data Format
The processed data files follow a consistent format optimized for the neural network model:

1. **Team data** includes statistical features like:
   - Offensive and defensive efficiency metrics
   - Tempo-adjusted statistics
   - Strength of schedule indicators
   - Historical performance metrics

2. **Matchup data** combines features from two teams, structured as:
   - Team1 features (all columns from team data)
   - Team2 features (all columns from team data)
   - Win probability columns (added by the prediction model)

## Usage
These processed data files are directly consumed by the neural network model for training and prediction. The matchup files are used to generate tournament predictions for each round.

```python
# Example of loading matchup data for prediction
import pandas as pd
matchups = pd.read_csv('matchups1.csv')
```

## Data Generation
These files are generated by the processing scripts in the parent directory. If you need to regenerate them, refer to the data processing workflow in the parent directory's README.
